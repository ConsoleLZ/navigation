## WV
WV, this name combines "Web" (network) and "Voyage" (voyage, travel). It encompasses various useful websites and projects I encountered during my learning process, including some software. I created this navigation website for my own convenience. It uses a completely static framework Nuxt. Anyone interested is welcome to check it out üòÄ

## Regarding Code Style Issues
This project was started by the author when they were just beginning and has gone through many iterations. As a result, the code style is somewhat inconsistent. The code style in the homepage is currently better, and updates will be made based on the number of followers.
