## WV
WV, this name combines "Web" (network) and "Voyage" (voyage, travel). It encompasses various useful websites and projects I encountered during my learning process, including some software. I created this navigation website for my own convenience. It uses a completely static framework Nuxt. Anyone interested is welcome to check it out 😀
